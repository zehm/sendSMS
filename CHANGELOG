# Changelog:
# v0.2.4     03/08/2006
#   Incorporated patch to add Alltell Wireless support (provided by Anthony
#   Valley).  Marked Cricket support as deprecated, since Cricket is
#   specifically blocking scripts such as this one through technical measures.
#   CRICKET support will be removed in a future release.

#   changed their website again (thanks to Joel Chen for his help).

#

#   Incorporated change to Sprint PCS profile to reflect changes on their
#   website - they only send 'Message sent' now (reported by Ken Cochran).
#   Added global version/date/copyright variables to code so help screen
#   gives program info without having to modify it in multiple places.
#   Simplified the help screen by removing "written by:" and extra CR's.

#   Brandon Zehm
#
# v0.1.4     04/04/2002

#   Brandon Zehm
#
# v0.1.3     01/22/2001
#   Some changes to get this running on Win32 (ActiveState 5.6.0/build 623).
#   Couldn't get POSIX::termios or IO::Select to correctly make STDIN non-
#   blocking, so I gave up after ~4 hrs of trying, and simply removed the
#   STDIN message-sending functionality for Win32.  If someone out there
#   can send me a patch (and NOT simply include an external module, such as
#   Term::ReadKey or something) then maybe it'll be supported.
#   Paul Kreiner
#
# v0.1.2     01/20/2001
#   Added support for passing a message via STDIN.  Got the list of providers
#   in the help sub to be dynamically generated, making it that much easier to
#   add service providers (only two places to edit, now.)  Implemented signal
#   trapping for cleaner exits.  Added support for Cellular One (unverified).
#   Minor code cleanups.
#   Paul Kreiner
#
# v0.1.1     01/17/2001
#   Update to improve modularity and make adding new providers much easier
#   than before.   Finished removing any global vars, just because I can.
#   Replaced original encodeAsURL code with much more efficient algorithm.  I
#   think that was the last of Brandon's original code.
#   Paul Kreiner
#
# v0.1.0     01/15/2001
#   Initial 'beta' release.  Basic functionality in place, although modularity
#   needs to be improved.  This is a full rewrite of the original sendSMS.pl
#   script, with commentary, support for multiple providers, and a more robust
#   user interface.  Includes support for AT&T WS and VoiceStream (verified).
